# Service-Repo

## Description
This project tries to implement a NodeJS, ExpressJS, KnexJS and MongoDB powered application using repository pattern and dependency injection. The main idea is to be an application that is independent of any framework or database. This application uses Typescript and in the coming days I'd be looking at dockerizing the application for the fun of it ðŸ˜‚

## Running the app

- Create a `.env` file in the project's directory
- Copy the contents of the `.env.example` into `.env`
- Edit the variables

```bash
# install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# run the app
$ yarn run dev
```
